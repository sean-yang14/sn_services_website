            The answer is easy, because we put you first. In fact, your success is our only goal. Recruiting firms, DSO recruiters, and practice owners ultimately care more about the employer than you. We decided to change that, and so instead of working for the employers, we work for you. That means a partnership with Scrub Network provides you with greatest possible access to jobs and a partner that you can truly rely on throughout the entire job search process, including negotiations. Plus, we use our expertise to provide you a level of service that no other company provides.
