            Our vision is for every dental professional to feel that they have the tools, support and mentorship to achieve their dream career.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-base sm:text-lg leading-8 font-sans font-light">
            Our goal is to be the provider of those tools and to create a community of support and mentorship that&apos;s also a lot of fun to be a part of.

            Finding a job can be hard, particularly for dentists earlier in their career. We make the process easier, but we still need you to be an active participant in the journey. Our ask is that you come into a partnership with Scrub Network ready to put in the work. Our promise to you is that we&apos;ll always have your back.
