              Hey everyone -
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-base sm:text-lg leading-8 font-sans font-light">
              I'm Sean, founder here at Scrub Network.

              I started this project after seeing the dentists in my life, people I care deeply about, struggle navigating their career post-graduation. It was frustrating to see the same problems pop up over and over again. These weren&apos;t struggles necessary to become a better dentist, yet they often left people questioning whether they made a mistake pursuing a career in dentistry or even worse, questioning their self worth.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-base sm:text-lg leading-8 font-sans font-light">
              Your career should be enjoyable and rewarding, not plagued by horror stories about a bad employer, unfair contract, low pay or loneliness! My goal is to remove these problems from the world of dentistry (as much as we can).
            </p>

              If you resonate with the idea that dentistry should work better for dentists, I want to ask for your help making that a reality. We&apos;ve built a number of tools, but the primary one we&apos;re focusing on is the Compensation Dashboard. In order for that to be a success, we need your contribution of data and spreading the word to friends. We also love hearing feedback on how we can improve, so don&apos;t hesitate to reach out!

              A quick shout out to the team at Scrub Network. I&apos;ve been fortunate to meet like-minded individuals and have gathered a team of dentists, software engineers and business folk to make our goal a reality. For everyone on the team, this is a passion project that we spend time on after working our day jobs.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-base sm:text-lg leading-8 font-sans font-light">
              Let&apos;s work together to create a better post-graduation world for dentists, the way it should be.
            </p>
